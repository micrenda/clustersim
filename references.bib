	abstract = {If certain preconditions are met, the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) kinetic equation is exactly accurate for nucleation and growth reactions with linear growth and is, at least, a good approximation for nucleation and growth reactions with parabolic growth. These preconditions include randomly distributed product phases, isotropic growth and constant equilibrium state. Mechanisms causing deviations from these preconditions include: capillarity effect, vacancy annihilation, blocking due to anisotropic growth. It is shown that deviations lead to a modification of the overall transformation, which can be approximated well by a single equation: α=1−[⟨k⟨T⟩t⟩nsηi+1]−ηi{\textbackslash}alpha = 1 - {\textbackslash}left[ \{{\textbackslash}frac\{\{{\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}langle \{k{\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}langle T {\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}rangle t\} {\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}rangle {\textasciicircum}\{n\_s \} \}\}\{\{{\textbackslash}eta \_i \}\} + 1\} {\textbackslash}right]{\textasciicircum}\{ - {\textbackslash}eta \_i \} where α is the fraction transformed, η i is the impingement parameter, n s and k(T) are parameters that depend on growth geometry and growth rate. The factors which influence the impingement parameter are discussed.},

	abstract = {Up to now, the time dependence of the volume fraction during a first-order phase transition has been often described by Avrami’s model, in which nucleation is assumed to occur randomly in the infinite volume. In this paper we present a computer simulation of the phase transition in order to verify the validity of Avrami’s kinetics in the cases of random and nonrandom distribution of germ nuclei. Our results indicate that Avrami’s kinetics is the correct solution, provided the distribution of nuclei is random and the extended volume is computed by including the so-called phantom nuclei. It is also shown that the general solution in the form of a functional of the extended volumes is appropriate for both nucleus distributions. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

	abstract = {Theoretical results on the kinetics of transformations with nucleation and growth mechanisms in homogeneous systems during isothermal annealing are reported. The present derivations start from a probability calculation in a finite discrete assembly. In the simplest case with a constant growth rate the results of the formulation agree with the classical Avrami equation for two‐ and three‐dimensional systems. Furthermore, by calculating the survival probability step by step for separate occurrences, the relationships between interfering processes and the effects of neighboring nuclei are revealed. In particular, the distribution of nuclei pairs with distance is determined. Various cases of preferred nucleation in specialized regions, such as linear zones (e.g., dislocations), planar areas (e.g., grain boundaries), or three‐dimensional partial volumes, are analytically solved and these solutions can be directly used for the interpretation and evaluation of experimental measurements.},

	abstract = {In the past it has been suggested that the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation can be used to describe the progress of a large number of nucleation and growth reactions, including diffusion-controlled precipitation reactions, provided that nucleation is random. However, its validity has only been proved for reactions with a linear growth and not for diffusion-controlled precipitation reactions. Here, the ability of the JMAK equation to fit the experimental data of diffusion-controlled precipitation reactions has been compared with the Austin-Rickett (AR) equation α=1−\{[k(T)t]n+1\}-1 In all cases studied the AR equation provides a better fit to the data and the obtained integer and half-integer values of n can be interpreted in terms of the physics of the transformation processes. The latter is mostly not possible for n values obtained from the JMAK equation. It is concluded that for the purpose of interpreting data of precipitation reactions, the AR equation is more appropriate than the JMAK equation.},
